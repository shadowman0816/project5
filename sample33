Before I head out for my vacation next week, I wanted to share the latest status update on the three JIRAs related to the Communicator/Notification Service:
	1.	Communicator/Notification Service Deployment:
Successfully deployed in the dev environment. All runtime configurations and SQS connectivity have been established and verified.
	2.	Message Producer Implementation:
The producer logic to publish messages to the SQS queue has been completed.
	3.	KMS & RPU Setup:
Currently in progress. This includes the necessary encryption and permission configurations.
	4.	QA Environment Migration:
Pending. This will begin once the KMS setup is completed.

Please let me know if you need anything else before I sign off.
